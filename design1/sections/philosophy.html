        <h3>My Artistic Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I believe that art should evoke emotion, provoke thought, and create connections. Every brushstroke is intentional, every color choice meaningful. My goal is not just to create beautiful images, but to create experiences that resonate with the viewer long after they've looked away.</p>
